# Agentic Architecture System

## Overview
This is a comprehensive agentic system architecture designed to:
- Build and manage autonomous agents
- Test code and solutions
- Create and manage task boards and step-by-step tasks
- Enable agent-to-agent (A2A) communication
- Analyze and decompose complex problems into iterative steps
- Support multi-iteration development (e.g., simple server → Dockerized server → Multi-component architecture)

## Core Components
- Agent Builder: Creates new agents with specific capabilities
- Task Manager: Decomposes problems and manages task execution
- Communication Layer: Facilitates A2A interactions
- Testing Framework: Validates code and solutions
- Iteration Engine: Manages multi-iteration development processes
